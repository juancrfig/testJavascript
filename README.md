# Kanban Board for Momentum

I decided to start designing the website as mobile first to take advantage of the natural
flow of the HTML elements, so I can save time. However, I noticed the importance of using
frameworks which could have saved me a lot more of time in this exam. 

I decided to use localStorage to save time, given that  setting up an external server might 
take more time than I have. 


I missed to add functionality when the user is not logged in. 

When the browser detects a session the app achieves:
1. Add tasks in their respective board.
2. Generate a modal for each task dynamically when the user clicks on it.

It's missing:
1. Changing task to the board the user selects
2. Delete task.
