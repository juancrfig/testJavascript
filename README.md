# Kanban Board for Momentum

I decided to start designing the website as mobile first to take advantage of the natural
flow of the HTML elements, so I can save time. However, I noticed the importance of using
frameworks which could have saved me a lot more of time in this exam. 

I decided to use localStorage to save time, given that  setting up an external server might 
take more time than I have. 


I couldn't complete the visual addition of tasks in the boards, the new tasks are added only successfully
in localStorage. 

My slow coding speed is my weakness. I have to learn a framework.
